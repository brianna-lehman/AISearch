General Questions

* What type of file is the problem configuration file? - this would be so much easier if we were given a file to test the program on
* Node class
* Problem class

Monitoring Questions

* Euclidean distance: given (a, b) & (x, y): sqrt( (a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 )
* Sensor class - inherets Node
* Target class - inherets Node
* What is P(sub t)?
* P(sub t) = Sensor.power - distance between sensor and target
* Goal: All the targets are being monitored by a sensor
